Mathematical Construction of Interpolation and Extrapolation Function by Taylor Polynomials

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11438.pdf

Abstract: In this present paper, I propose a derivation of unified interpolation and
extrapolation function that predicts new values inside and outside the given range
by expanding direct Taylor series on the middle point of given data set. Mathematical construction of experimental model derived in general form. Trigonometric and
Power functions adopted as test functions in the development of the vital aspects in
numerical experiments. Experimental model was interpolated and extrapolated on
data set that generated by test functions. The results of the numerical experiments
which predicted by derived model compared with analytical values.
